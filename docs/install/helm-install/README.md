# Overview

Gluu Flex enables organizations to build a scalable centralized authentication and authorization service using free open source software.

The components of the project include client and server implementations of the OAuth, OpenID Connect, SCIM and FIDO standards.

All these components are deployed using Gluu [helm chart](https://github.com/GluuFederation/flex/blob/main/flex-cn-setup/pygluu/kubernetes/templates/helm/gluu).

You can check the [reference](../../reference/kubernetes/helm-chart.md) guide to view the list of the chart components and values.
